			<h2>Professional Biography</h2>
			<p>My name is Tyler Ross. I study computer science at the University of Missouri - Kansas City. I am currently in my third year of school for a major in computer science and a minor in integrated performing arts. My primary skills include Python and C++. I am also familiar with frameworks like VisualStudio and GitHub. I am currently learning HTML/CSS and unity, and I’m studying cybersecurity and algorithms. Projects I am typically drawn to involve the development of video games, or analyses of data. I am interested in work that combines creativity with my technical skills. My main inspirations for work often involve a feeling of fulfillment from my work as well as a competence to it. My career goal includes working in a specific role for a team on a creative project that allows my skills to shine. I am currently open to internship/part-time positions in the greater Kansas City area or greater St. Louis area.</p>
